Carnival style shooter game!
I developed this game as part of a Web Tech project at uni in a team of 2.
[ðŸŽ® Play here!](https://duh.github.io/carnival-shooter/)

## How to play
The game offers a simple, but replayable experience.
### Easy mode
You will have a 60 second timer, and targets will slide horizontally across the screen. Click on them to shoot them down! The faster you react to a target, the more points you will get from hitting it. Watch out, some targets move faster than others.

### Hard mode
Similar to easy mode, you will have 60 seconds to shoot down as many targets as quickly as you can. However, the targets can now slide in any direction across the screen, and move much faster.

Additionally, **evil targets** are introduced; don't click on targets with **inverted colours** or you will lose points!
